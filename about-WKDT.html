        <h2>History</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In 1954, KDET was heard through the electrical outlets in Central Area. Cadets plugged radios into electrical outlets in the barracks to hear the “carrier current” station, whose AM signals were transmitted through the USMA power lines. In 1972, the club was granted permission to begin on-air broadcasts, and the station was given a new name – WKDT.<br><br>Today, WKDT is the musical backbone of the Corps of Cadets. In addition to providing radio entertainment over 89.3 FM, the club also provides music and sound support for many cadet functions. Members regularly support a wide range of events, including Spirit Dinners, Brigade Boxing Open Tournaments, the Cow Club, Company and Department parties, and Intramural Championships. Additionally, WKDT is “the Voice of the Corps”, providing live radio coverage of Army football, and has previously supported basketball, baseball, rugby, lacrosse, and hockey.<br><br> Most importantly, WKDT members develop close friendships with each other in their time working with the club. Cadets involved in WKDT come down to the station regularly to produce music, to host radio shows, to hone their DJ skills, to maintain sound equipment and the radio station, and to spend time with friends. WKDT is the media hub of the Corps of Cadets, providing media support for events of all kinds.</p>

            <p>WKDT uses donations to sustain the club, as these are only some of the regular costs associated with the club:<p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recurring Costs:</strong> Music Licensing, Hosting Fees, Uniform Purchases, Vehicle Maintenance</li>
                <li><strong>Intermittent Costs:</strong> Food, Station Upkeep & Maintenance, Equipment Upkeep & Replacement </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Additionally, WKDT hopes to grow in the future but needs funds to support these initiatives:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preservation:</strong> Renovate the radio station while conserving the aspects that make it still feel like home to all WKDT members, not only cadets currently serving the Corps but also old grads visiting to reminsce.</li>
                <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Replace the large, inefficient Ford E-350 box truck with a more compact, efficient Ford Transit van, capable of carrying both equipment and personnel with ease, and less fuel usage.</li>
                <li><strong>Modernization:</strong> Modernize the current radio station setup including new servers, new software, new microphones, and sound booth renovations.</li>
            </ul>
